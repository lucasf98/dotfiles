Overview
--------
These are the dotfiles used for my personal setup, for both home and work, across 
Linux (Ubuntu), macOS, and Cygwin on Windows. Some of the customizations are
specifically to accomodate differences between these environments and to allow for machine-specific customization (e.g. work-specific changes for proxy, etc.).
